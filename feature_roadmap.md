# Feature Roadmap

## Phase I
- integrate all of the feed blockers (facebook, linkedin) 
- set up website

## Phase II
- integrate all of the minimal elements that block/eradicate + declutter the sites and add barriers to entry (in terms of usage)
- add mindfl integrations to each site over time (nest under 1 master extension, add features independently over time)
- delay site load + make facebook frustrating difficult to use over time (defacebook)
- declutter interface (get rid of news feed, timeline, and set conditional logic (if user has finished their main tasks for the day + is intentionally deciding to log time in distraction, then proceed given that the site will be greyscale, delayed site load, minimal (no news feed, no unnecessary bloat)
