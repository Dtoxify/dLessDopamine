# Backlog

- draw out architecture on paper
- create UI design on figma
- set up company wordpress site + blog
- set up pages for company (product hunt, linkedin, facebook, twitter, indiehackers, chrome web store, github)
- release mv product (all in 1 feed blocker)
- write out coherent feature roadmap in order to understand how exactly that you will scale out and build all of the features (greyscale, removing site clutter, delaying site load, defacebook implementation, removing news feeds and other unnecessary bloat, the master control panel, muting users at once)
